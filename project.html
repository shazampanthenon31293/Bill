                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(2)</span> Rich people have not payed their fair share</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(3)</span> Wall Street has lobbied Congress for looser rules and regulations</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(4)</span> Wall Street is richer than normal people</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(5)</span> The global financial crisis cost Americans $19 trillion in lost wealth.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(6)</span> The global financial crisis was caused by financial firms taking great financial risks without disclosing those risks to their investors or their regulators</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(7)</span> Deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial practices have harmed public confidence in the integrity and fairness of many United States financial institutions, and threaten the basic strengths of the United States economic system.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(8)</span> American citizens provided the money to stabilize the financial sector, making $700 billion available to 800 financial institutions, automakers, and insurance companies.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(9)</span> The global financial crisis, along with the wars, unabated and unaddressed climate change, unsustainable tax cuts, and a continuing unemployment crisis, if unaddressed, will deprive a generation of a meaningful role in the larger economy.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(10)</span> According to economists, a small tax on transfer of ownership of every financial trade could generate hundreds of billions annually in revenue, which when invested could help create millions of good-paying jobs in both the public and private sectors every year, as well as provide urgently needed funding for programs to combat climate change and address global health and development issues.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(11)</span> A transactions tax will help limit high frequency trading which may be as high as 70 percent of the market and results in declining market stability through extreme price volatility, distorted market prices, and structural vulnerability to speculation far in excess of the liquidity needs of commercial hedgers.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(12)</span> A Tax on Wall Street Speculation would raise $220 billion per year in new tax revenues</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(13)</span> Forty nations have or have had some form of a financial transactions tax; it is endorsed by more than 1,000 economists; and 10 European countries are moving forward on implementing a coordinated financial transactions tax after European Union finance ministers signaled approval in January 2013.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="font-size:100%" class="s2">(14)</span> Extreme weather events rooted in climate change, including flood, drought, fire, super storms like Sandy, as well as “slow-onset” events like sea level rise, are wreaking havoc in the United States and across the globe resulting in climate change impacts that jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of Americans, causing large-scale food and energy insecurity in developing countries, and extolling untold economic costs.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="subsection">Congress finds the following:</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(1)</span> During the 20-year period preceding the date of enactment of this Act, activity by private equity funds has exploded.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(2)</span> Millions of people in communities across the United States rely on companies that are owned by private equity funds, including nearly 12,000,000 individuals who work for companies owned by those funds. For millions of additional individuals, a private investment fund acts as a landlord, a lender, or an owner of a local grocery store, newspaper, or hospital. Many pension funds are also investors in private investment funds.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(3)</span> Private investment funds have taken controlling stakes in companies in a wide variety of industries, including the financial services, real estate, media, and healthcare industries, but some of the largest impacts from private investment funds have been in the retail sector. In the 5 years preceding the date of enactment of this Act, cases have been commenced under title 11, United States Code, with respect to dozens of retailers in the United States, including Sears, Toys “R” Us, Shopko, Payless ShoeSource, Charlotte Russe, Bon-Ton, Nine West, David’s Bridal, Claire’s, J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Guitar Center, Art Van Furniture, and Southeastern Grocers, which was the parent company for BI–LO and Winn-Dixie.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(4)</span> Private investment funds have also targeted entities that serve low-income or vulnerable populations, including affordable housing developments, for-profit colleges, payday lenders, medical providers, and nursing homes.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(5)</span>While private investment funds often purport to take over struggling companies and make those companies viable, the opposite is often true. Leveraged buyouts impose enormous debt loads on otherwise viable companies and then strip those companies of assets, hobbling the operations of those companies and preventing them from making necessary investments for future growth. If an investment goes well, the fund reaps most of the rewards, but if the investment does not go well, workers and customers of the company, and the community relying on the company, suffer.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(6)</span> Regardless of the performance of a private investment fund, the managers of the fund often make profits through fees, dividends, and other financial engineering. Private funds should have a stake in the outcome of their investments, enjoying returns if those investments are successful but absorbing losses if those investments fail.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(7)</span> When a case is commenced under title 11, United States Code, with respect to a portfolio company, workers not only lose jobs, but also lose wages and benefits that are owed, severance pay that has been promised, and pensions that have been earned. Workers should not be sent to the back of the line behind other creditors if, through no fault of those workers, an investment fails.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(8)</span> The performance of private investment funds is often cloaked in secrecy. Those funds have full control over the information that the funds disclose to investors, which allows the funds to manufacture their own performance metrics and makes it difficult for an investor to compare the returns to other investment options. Funds also increasingly require investors to waive the fiduciary obligations applicable to the funds. Investors should have the information and bargaining power to take control over their own investments.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(9)</span> An increasing amount of risky debt is being introduced into the market and the quality of that debt is deteriorating, raising concerns with regulators and lawmakers about systemic risk. The institutions that make and securitize risky loans collect large fees and then pass on risk to unwitting investors. The financial system should not bear all of the risk while lenders and securitizers reap the rewards.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span class="s2">(10)</span> The Federal Government should—</p>
                <p class="pt3">(A) protect workers, companies, consumers, and investors in the United States; and</p>
                <p class="pt3">(B) put an end to the practice of looting economically viable companies for the enrichment of private investment fund managers.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="subsection">Congress finds the following:</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(1)</span></strong> There are an estimated 2,200,000 domestic workers across the United States working in private homes to provide home and personal care, child care, and house-cleaning services.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Domestic work is a job-enabling job that makes all other work possible. It is labor that cannot be outsourced to individuals abroad, nor is it close to being automated. Without the millions of domestic workers caring for children, seniors, and people with disabilities, and cleaning homes, much of the economy would come to a standstill.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> During the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic, domestic work and other low-wage service jobs, disproportionately held by women, women of color, and immigrants, have been deemed essential. This crisis has shown how essential these jobs have always been to our economy. At great risk to the health of themselves and their families, domestic workers have worked on the frontlines of the pandemic to provide care to those more vulnerable to COVID&ndash;19, seniors, and individuals with disabilities, and have provided child care for the children of essential workers. A study of Black immigrant domestic workers conducted by the Institute for Policy Studies and the National Domestic Workers Alliance in May and June of 2020 found that 25 percent of workers surveyed experienced or lived with someone who has experienced COVID&ndash;19 symptoms. 73 percent of such workers surveyed indicated that they did not received personal protective equipment (&ldquo;PPE&rdquo;) from their employers.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Domestic workers experienced a rapid and sustained loss of jobs during the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic, which exacerbated the existing financial insecurity experienced by many domestic workers. Surveys from the National Domestic Workers Alliance and NDWA Labs between March and September 2020 found that for 6 consecutive months more than half of domestic workers surveyed were unable to pay their rent or mortgage. Nearly &frac34; of workers surveyed did not receive any compensation when their jobs were canceled.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span></strong> The employment of individuals in domestic service in households affects commerce, as described in section 2(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:29%20section:202%20edition:prelim)">29 U.S.C. 202(a)</a>).</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(6)</span></strong> Domestic workers are hired or contacted for work by phone, mail, or internet, or through newspaper ads, and travel to work through transportation on interstate highways, interstate transit, or vehicles in interstate commerce.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(7)</span></strong> In 2019, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that between 2019 and 2029&mdash;</p>
                <p class="pt3"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(A)</span></strong> the number of new jobs for home health and personal care aides will increase by 34 percent, which is an increase of 1,159,500 jobs and the largest increase in new jobs of any occupational category during such period; and</p>
                <p class="pt3"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(B)</span></strong> the number of new jobs for child care and house cleaning positions will increase by 6 to 7 percent.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(8)</span></strong> The COVID&ndash;19 pandemic has increased the demand for in-home child care. According to the Center for Translational Neuroscience, the percentage of parents reporting use of home-based child care has grown since the onset of the pandemic from 27 percent to 31 percent.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(9)</strong></span> An increasing number of workers, including domestic workers, are finding work on online platforms. An analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that between 2013 and 2018, the percentage of adults that had earned income from online platforms increased from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(10)</strong></span> 9 out of 10 domestic workers are women, and such women are disproportionately people of color and immigrants. Women, people of color, and immigrants have historically faced barriers to employment and economic advancement. According to the Economic Policy Institute, domestic workers also tend to be older than other workers. 2 in 5 domestic workers are age 50 or older, while just 1&frasl;3 of all other workers are at least 50 years old.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(11)</strong></span> Domestic workers are paid low wages, can be subjected to workplace health and safety hazards, and face difficulties saving for retirement. An Economic Policy Institute analysis of data from the Current Population Survey indicates that the average wage for a domestic worker is approximately $12 per hour or $15,980 per year if working full-time. In practice, the average wage for a domestic worker is less than such approximation given that domestic work has largely been negotiated in the informal labor market.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(12)</strong></span> Low-wage workers, including domestic workers, experience high rates of minimum wage and overtime violations, violations of laws related to workers' compensation and other workplace benefits, and illegal retaliation. A 2017 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that 2,400,000 workers&mdash;17 percent of the low-wage workforce&mdash;experiences wage theft. A 2009 report from the National Employment Law Project found that employment in private homes was one of the 3 industries with the highest rates of employment and labor law violations.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(13)</strong></span> A landmark study of domestic workers published in 2012 by the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Urban Economic Development of the University of Illinois at Chicago Data Center titled &ldquo;Home Economics: The Invisible and Unregulated World of Domestic Work&rdquo; indicated poor working conditions across the domestic workers industry. The findings of such study included that&mdash;</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(A)</strong></span> domestic workers have little control over their working conditions, and employment is usually arranged without a written contract;</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(B)</strong></span> 35 percent of domestic workers interviewed reported that they worked long hours without breaks in the year immediately preceding the interview;</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(C)</strong></span> 25 percent of live-in domestic workers had responsibilities that prevented them from getting at least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night during the week immediately preceding the interview; and</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(D)</strong></span> 91 percent of domestic workers interviewed who encountered problems with their working conditions in the year immediately preceding the interview did not complain about their working conditions because they were afraid they would lose their job.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(14)</strong></span> The study described in paragraph (13) found that domestic workers have little access to federally supported employment benefits. For instance&mdash;</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(A)</strong></span> less than 2 percent of such workers receive retirement or pension benefits, and less than 9 percent of such workers work for employers that collect payroll taxes on wages paid to such workers to provide eligibility for Social Security benefits; and</p>
                <p class="pt3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(B)</strong></span> 65 percent of such workers do not have health insurance, and only 4 percent of such workers receive employer-provided insurance, despite the fact that domestic work is hazardous and often results in illness or physical injuries.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span></strong> Compounding these challenges is the fact that many domestic workers have been, and in many cases continue to be, excluded from key provisions of labor and employment laws like the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=29&amp;section=651">29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.</a>), and the National Labor Relations Act (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=29&amp;section=151">29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.</a>). Live-in domestic workers employed by private households remain excluded from the overtime protections in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=29&amp;section=201">29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.</a>). Minimum employee threshold rules, misclassification of domestic workers as independent contractors, and exclusion of independent contractors from coverage mean that most domestic workers are also de facto excluded from Federal civil rights protections, including protections under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=29&amp;section=2000e">29 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.</a>) and other laws.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(16)</strong></span> The International Labour Organization&rsquo;s Domestic Workers Convention, adopted in 2011, calls for domestic workers to have the right to freedom of association and collective actions, protections against harassment, privacy rights, and the right to be informed of conditions of employment. This Convention also calls for the right of domestic workers to keep their travel documents, the right to overtime compensation and rest breaks, the right to minimum wage coverage, the right to occupational safety and health protections, and mechanisms to pursue complaints and ensure compliance with the law.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(17)</strong></span> The unique nature of their work, in private homes with individuals and families, also often makes it difficult for domestic workers to use Federal programs and policies to improve their skills and training and to join together collectively to negotiate better pay and working conditions.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(18)</strong></span> Many domestic workers are also vulnerable to discrimination and sexual harassment. These issues are further exacerbated by the unique working conditions faced by domestic workers, such as isolation, poverty, immigration status, the lack of familiarity with the law and legal processes, limited networks for support, language barriers, and fear of retaliation and deportation.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(19)</strong></span> Millions of older individuals, individuals with disabilities, and families are increasingly relying on domestic workers. By bringing domestic work out of the shadows and creating incentives and investments that help raise wages and standards for domestic workers, the Federal Government can lift millions of the most vulnerable workers out of poverty, reduce turnover due to poor working conditions, thereby enhancing quality of care, and support the millions of working and retired people of the United States who rely on them.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(20)</strong></span> It is the duty of the Federal Government to dramatically expand and strengthen the care economy, healing and supporting the country as we emerge from the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic and face the challenges of the 21st century and beyond;</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(21)</strong></span> Our ultimate aim is to build an economy and society based on care for people, communities, and the planet we all share.</p>
                <p class="pt2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(22)</strong></span> The Federal Government has left the domestic workers behind when it comes to Labor Standards, Overtime and so much more and that the federal government shall make sure that this injustice is fixed</p>

            <div>
                <p class="subsection">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
                <p class="pt2">(1) The communities that have been most harmed by cannabis prohibition are benefiting the least from the legal marijuana marketplace.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(2) A legacy of racial and ethnic injustices, compounded by the disproportionate collateral consequences of 80 years of cannabis prohibition enforcement, now limits participation in the industry.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(3) 37 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis, and 15 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have adopted laws legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(4) A total of 47 States have reformed their laws pertaining to cannabis despite the Schedule I status of marijuana and its Federal criminalization.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(5) Legal cannabis sales totaled $20,000,000,000 in 2020 and are projected to reach $40,500,000,000 by 2025.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(6) According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), enforcing cannabis prohibition laws costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 billion a year.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(7) The continued enforcement of cannabis prohibition laws results in over 600,000 arrests annually, disproportionately impacting people of color who are almost 4 times&nbsp;more&nbsp;likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than their White counterparts, despite equal rates of use across populations.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(8) People of color have been historically targeted by discriminatory sentencing practices resulting in Black men receiving drug sentences that are 13.1 percent longer than sentences imposed for White men and Latinos being nearly 6.5 times&nbsp;more&nbsp;likely to receive a Federal sentence for cannabis possession than non-Hispanic Whites.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(9) In 2013, simple cannabis possession was the fourth most common cause of deportation for any offense and the most common cause of deportation for drug law violations.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(10) Fewer than one-fifth of cannabis business owners identify as minorities and only approximately 4 percent are black.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(11) Applicants for cannabis licenses are limited by numerous laws, regulations, and exorbitant permit applications, licensing fees, and costs in these States, which can require&nbsp;more&nbsp;than $700,000.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(12) Historically disproportionate arrest and conviction rates make it particularly difficult for people of color to enter the legal cannabis marketplace, as most States bar these individuals from participating.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(13) Federal law severely limits access to loans and capital for cannabis businesses, disproportionately impacting minority small business owners.</p>
                <p class="pt2">(14) Some States and municipalities have taken proactive steps to mitigate inequalities in the legal cannabis marketplace and ensure equal participation in the industry.</p>
